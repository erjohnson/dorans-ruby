# Dorans

A Ruby client for the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

This project is a work in progress.

## About

After searching around for a Riot API client, I decided there wasn't one which suited my needs. Thus Dorans was born.

My primary goal is to have a sane(ish) interface to retrieve & work with [game timeline data](https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods#!/929/3214).
